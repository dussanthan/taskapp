Hi ! I am Dusssanthan

This is a Task Managing Web Application.
Created with HTML,CSS,Boostrap,JavaScript,PHP and MySql.
I have use the XAMPP mysql server for this application.
First we have to start the apache and mysql in xampp control panel.
Then copy this taskapp folder in to the folder like hddocs where your xampp is installed.
After open your browser and type the URL as localhost/phpmyadmin.
In that you can choose your taskapp folder and import the the file assigned with this folder named as taskapp.sql.
After successful import you can see your tables.
Then in your browser type the URL as localhost/TaskApp/home.php.
Then you can see a home page and Click the name as TaskManager and you can use it.
Thank you !!!...
